# Relationships and Traps

Book is from Honza Vojtko, it is his second book and it was 
released after the podcast series Vztahy a pasti.

## Boring

The relationship gets boring in the time. That is a myth that is not true.
You may say, that in the begginng of the relationships, you felt the butterflies,
you thought that all will be good and you will be fulfilled till the end of times.

That is because of the chemistry. Just pure instincts that our subconscious does 
for us. Huge amount of the dopamine and serotonin is released for a few months.
Then the hormones gets into a line again.

All of the feelings you don't have to feel and you are most likely not feeling bored at all.
There are three types of a situation when you feel bored:
1. If you are forbidden of doing what you want.
2. If you are forced to do somehting that you don't want
3. Sometimes is just a feeling that you can find out, why you have it.

All of this is comming from lack of the purpose. When you are a guy,
this is a huge issue. You should have purpose, from small to great, but some.
Start with some hobby, you will feel better. This is also true for a 
females. If you are bored in a relationship, find why are you feeling like that.
The other person is not there to satisfy your lack of purpose, but help you 
find one and stick to it. Find your purpose together and work on it as a team.

### What to Ask

1. Can I do something with my partner?
2. Do I let him inspire me?
3. Can I do the new activity, pursue the purpose alone?
4. Can I share the achivements with my partner?
5. Why do I need to do something new? 
   

## Need for sex

Sexuality is a huge question, but why? Is it really a question that we ask or is the 
society putting a value to it. You will read that if you want a healthy relationsh ip 
you will have to have sex twice a week. This is a huge mistake. Every person has it
differently. 

The main goal is to have the intimacy that suits both of you. It can be holding hands,
kisses or planning and having a quality time with some touches. Not everyone needs to
penetrate or be penetrated to have a good relationship if he doesn't want to.

It is likely that someone will want sex more in a relationship. It is not an issue,
if you will not use it as a weapon, as you can manipulate with the one thing that 
the other one desire. 

There will also be ups and down in the long run. In this time, be open, look for help 
in your spouse, you are going through it together. If it will be for a longer period 
of time, that someone doesn't want to have sex. Look deeper, it can be from some 
physical state or a state of mind that needs to be cured.

Remember that if you not feel satisfied, talk about it, it can be not pleasant and it can 
be hurtful. There might be even more talks about it, cus you will not solve it through one
hour talk if it is a bigger issue.
