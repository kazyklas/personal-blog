# Positive Masculinity

It's a male centric backlash movement towards a female centric modern world. 
It sustains that if you are a man, you should become strong both physically and mentally and reject modern 
concepts such as: <strong>toxic masculinity, simping, white knighting, fatphobia </strong>
(don't go to the gym, date fat girls), etc.

Modernity in this case is portrayed as a dominant world view where diversity and inclusivity 
at all levels are preferred at the expense of a traditional male mentality. 

Masculinity in this case is defined as the heritage and nature of men to solve problems, 
be strong and lead the world. It suggests that men should be <strong>stoic, heroic, and strong </strong>
for the world to be a better place and avoid the decay and descent towards depravity modernity offers.
