# About

Hi, I'm glad that you are here. Let's talk about what this blog is suppose to do 
for you. It is here to help you navigate through life as best, as you possibly can.
It takes some knowledge and tries to put it into your head.

You can ignore what you read here, laugh or hate, but the blog doesn't care.
I don't care. I'm writting this with best intentions and I will tell you more about them.

## Mission

When you are talking about the mission, you should ask those questions

1. What you do now? <strong>I'm writting this blog to make myself write something and think about stuff.</strong>
2. From whom? <strong>From myself, nobody is forcing me to do this. I want to do it.</strong>
3. How you do it? <strong>Starting small with a blog, that everybody can ignore.</strong>
4. What this achieves? <strong>It will stay here and remind me to do something and potentionaly it will help the others.</strong>

## Vision

1. Where you're going? <strong>I'm going to educate myself and the people that want to be educated as well.</strong>
2. What your vision should ultimately achieve? <strong>The mission should reach as many people as it can and help them and me to live the 
best potential life as we can.</strong>

## Values

1. What you stand for? <strong>I stand for a good (not nice) man, I value family, positive masculinity, dignity, truth and many others that we 
will be introducing later.</strong>
