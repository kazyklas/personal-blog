# Eat that Frog!

By Brian Tracy, which is a popular self-help book focused on time management and productivity. The book's central premise is based on a quote by Mark Twain: "Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day." Essentially, this means that if you tackle your most difficult and important task first thing in the morning, everything else will seem easier in comparison.

The book offers a number of strategies for how to "eat your frog," or tackle your most important task. Some of the key strategies include setting clear goals, planning your day in advance, prioritizing tasks using the 80/20 rule, considering the consequences of not completing a task, and using the ABCDE method to prioritize tasks. The ABCDE method involves categorizing tasks as A, B, C, D, or E based on their level of importance, and then tackling the A tasks first.
