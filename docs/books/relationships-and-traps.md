# Relationships and Traps

Book is from Honza Vojtko, it is his second book and it was 
released after the podcast series Vztahy a pasti.

## Boredom

The relationship gets boring in the time. That is a myth that is not true.
You may say, that in the begginng of the relationships, you felt the butterflies,
you thought that all will be good and you will be fulfilled till the end of times.

That is because of the chemistry. Just pure instincts that our subconscious does 
for us. Huge amount of the dopamine and serotonin is released for a few months.
Then the hormones gets into a line again.

All of the feelings you don't have to feel and you are most likely not feeling bored at all.
There are three types of a situation when you feel bored:
1. If you are forbidden of doing what you want.
2. If you are forced to do somehting that you don't want
3. Sometimes is just a feeling that you can find out, why you have it.

All of this is comming from lack of the purpose. When you are a guy,
this is a huge issue. You should have purpose, from small to great, but some.
Start with some hobby, you will feel better. This is also true for a 
females. If you are bored in a relationship, find why are you feeling like that.
The other person is not there to satisfy your lack of purpose, but help you 
find one and stick to it. Find your purpose together and work on it as a team.

### What to Ask

1. Can I do something with my partner?
2. Do I let him inspire me?
3. Can I do the new activity, pursue the purpose alone?
4. Can I share the achivements with my partner?
5. Why do I need to do something new? 
   

## Need for sex

Sexuality is a huge question, but why? Is it really a question that we ask or is the 
society putting a value to it. You will read that if you want a healthy relationsh ip 
you will have to have sex twice a week. This is a huge mistake. Every person has it
differently. 

The main goal is to have the intimacy that suits both of you. It can be holding hands,
kisses or planning and having a quality time with some touches. Not everyone needs to
penetrate or be penetrated to have a good relationship if he doesn't want to.

It is likely that someone will want sex more in a relationship. It is not an issue,
if you will not use it as a weapon, as you can manipulate with the one thing that 
the other one desire. 

There will also be ups and down in the long run. In this time, be open, look for help 
in your spouse, you are going through it together. If it will be for a longer period 
of time, that someone doesn't want to have sex. Look deeper, it can be from some 
physical state or a state of mind that needs to be cured.

Remember that if you not feel satisfied, talk about it, it can be not pleasant and it can 
be hurtful. There might be even more talks about it, cus you will not solve it through one
hour talk if it is a bigger issue.

## What to ask

1. Did your desire changed somehow in time?
2. Is it still the same as in the beggining?
3. Is your desire higher or lower then your spouse?
4. Can you talk about it with your partner? (Couples that can talk about sex tend to have better sex.)
5. How does the social networks afects your perception on sex?

## Relationship as a terapeutic coach

This trap is about using your partner as a terapeut. You don't have to do it on 
purpose, but it will figure itself out. You will tell them, that they understand 
you better and in the edge cases. Some couples send the other person in a relationship
to the terapeut to solve their problems for them.

You may also tend to find the reason of the partners feelings, where did they 
come from? You may automaticaly analyse the person and not listen to what he says
or you can not enjoy the moment and live the emotions as well.

In the relationship, there is a right on having the secrets. It is on you 
if you want to tell it to your partner. Do forget on using your partner to 
throw all your emotions on. None can handle it in a long term relationship to 
be your pillow for emotions. Don't be afraid to advise to search the prefesional for this.

## What to ask

1. Is your partner the first one, that you contact when something wrong happens to you, and all the good things you tell to someone else?
2. Are you talking with your partner about the negative and the positive things?
3. Do you expect some resolution from your partner?
4. Are you mad if the partner is not properly listening to you? 

## Parents instead of partners

The first shock for the relationship is the baby. There might be another shocks,
but none with such a damage as a kid. The partners tend to focus on the little ones
and they completely forgets about the other person in the relationship.
The relationship is work and after a kid, double that work.

If we will focus on beeing a parent, we will lose ourselves. We have to constantly work
on the intimate relationship that we have. Partners can't start tolerating each other.
They will create a distance between themselves and it might not be repairable.

Don't just share what pempers you need to buy. Don't just be parent.
Share love, send some pictures, talk about the love between you and remeber to work on it.

Be also prepared that we have some urge to project our dreams and love to the baby.
It can couse the damage to the kid and also you and your partner.

### What to ask

1. Are you not talking about something, cus you are tired?
2. When was the last time you spend together, when the kid fell asleep?
3. Do you belive that the marriage is about creating children?
   
   
## Always at work

Everybody needs money, so we are going to work. This work can be great, can 
motivate us, but it can distract us from our relationship. It also can hide some 
problems that we are facing and we hide from them there.

One study showed that staying late in work doesn't have to be an issue in a relationship.
We have to communicate it, that this is something that is fulfiling us and we 
have a purpose there. If we do it properly and we find the right balance, the relationship 
can get even stronger.

The trick is in the communication. We have to remind each other that the work is 
something important for us. Once mentioned doesn't mean that much. We also have to 
react acordingly if the spouse is saying, that the work is affecting the relationship.

The necesity is to plan your week ahead. If you have tight schedule, take that few minutes
before the work week to plan ahead. Plan the time with your partner. You can even plan
the sex. Yes we want some spontaneity, but planning is not killer, it can create 
anticipation as well.

### What to ask

1. When was the last time we texted or called our partner how they are doing?
2. On a scale, how does it iritate you that your partner is working nonstop?
3. How much guilt are you feeling that you are working too much?
4. Do you enjoy the work, or do you work, because you need to?

## Social networks

They are a huge thing in our time. They can cause a lot of troubles, but it is not
their mistake, it is ours and how we are using them. A lot of people are on the 
social network and for a lot of time. If you want to have a serious relationship
you have to focus on it with full attention.

We keep on this media a lot of connections. If you add a photo, and someone from the 
past or even someone you don't even know reacts. You can keep this person somehow 
on the leash and you can have a backup if the relationship will not work out. 
It doesn't have to be now, or a week, but it can happen.

If I would bring up some numbers, and thats that we touch our phone 2600 times a day!
We can spend those 2600 touches on our partner, that would be that 15 minutes each day
that will make a huge difference.

There are a lot of profiles that will change your perception on your relationship.
Why are they laughing all the time, they don't have any issues, and so on...
Everybody has issues, you don't have to put yourself into this ilusion trap.
Statisticaly the partners, that are sharing a lot pictures whit each other, are not
actually that happy in a relationship. But the ones, that have the other one on the 
profile pictures tend to have stronger relationships.

### What to ask

1. How much time are you spending on social media?
2. When was the last time that you ate with your partner without looking into the phone? 
3. Did you argue about the social media? 
4. Do you like yourself more thaks to the social medias?

## The cursed romance

The love on the first sign is not a myth. But a huge computation done by our subconscious.
What the means? If we like somebody, if we are romanticaly attracted to them, we are most 
likely have different genes so our potential children have more chances on surviving.
So the nature created this process and when you seem someone with the set of different values.
You are in a trap, the brain starts to releas the soup of hormones and you are done (for a while).

All of how we are looking at the relationship has to do with Romantism. This shaped our 
perceptions and what we are expecting from the relationship. The love till the end of time,
everything fine after we find the right one and so on. Before the marrige was here to 
merge the properties of two families and to create children.

We have to have in mind that we are chosing the partner just on our emotions and feelings.
This can lead to not that great relationship in a long term as we get to know the other one better.
In the firt stages we are in love with just our imagination of a person. We have to take time 
to get to know each other, don't fall into a trap of an early relationship with the vision 
of the access to sex. 

The other thing that we need to avoid is, that there is no, once more, there is none template on
how the relationship should look like, or how we should feel. Every relationship is different 
and the feelings that we have are different as well. We don't have to have the butterflies 
when we see each other on the first sight, we just don't have to smell bad to each other.

And last few points. The love and sex are not the same. One can lead to another and one is 
not the prerequisity for the other. For someone can be, and that is OK as well. Talks about 
money and property is not a betrayel of love, but the necesity we need to go through. When 
we realize that we all are just people that are doing mistakes, we will create better 
relationships. So don't forget to learn how to communicate and how to respect each other.

### What to ask

1. Does your partenr understands your feelings?
2. What is it that you expect from your partner? 
3. How often do you think, if this is how the relationship should be and how it should feel?
4. Do you avoid tough conversations, because you don't think that they should be included in a relationship?
5. Do you believe in destiny?

## Parents

Parents, without the doubt has enormous impact on our relationships in the adult life.
This might be good, but not always. As I like to say, you can not fuck up the kid. It is up to us
to find what patterns are coded in our heads and is up to us to "upgrade" ourselves to 
better people. So the important thing to do is to determine, where did my communication and 
emotional patterns came from. Identify it, communicate them and get rid of those that you 
don't want. 

We will disscuss two archetypes. The arguing one and the passive aggresive one. Both
are not great. One needs to get more constructive with arguing to bring something positive
and the other one needs to learn how to express his emotions. Create a safe bridge in your 
relationship where you can communicate your emotions within a safe space.

Figure out what you are searching in a partner. Is it something that will compensate your 
areas, where you are not confident enough? I once also heard: "Create a list of what you 
are searching in your partner and become that person."

You have to watch on a trap in your relationship, that you might have a big connection 
to someone in your family. This may cause a weak point in the connection with your partner.
Don't include your parents in an arguments. Don't allow your parents to tell you how your 
relationship should look like. It can lead to serious problems. Do not be afraid to tell
that the connection is causing this and that and you are not comfortable with it.
The relationship is created by two people and no one should dictate how you should have it.

There was introduced a great concept of how we should treat our kids. When they are young,
keep them close, hug them, protect them. And as they grow older, releas the hug a bit. Let 
them get their burns and welcome them, if they need help. And as they become adult, wait
with the hands spread. Appreciate the time when they come to you. Hug them and then 
let them build their life and family. It will hurt, but it is your job and you have to be strong.

### What to ask

1. How often do you take the advice from your parents?
2. When was the last time you attacked your partner that they behave as their parents?
3. Do you talk about the intimate life with your parents?
4. Why and how often are you afraid what they will tell about your partenr?

## Always positive

In a recent studies were found out, that we argue mostly because of this three reasons:
1. Haughtiness: This means that our partner if making fools of us. Dehonests us or making fun from us. He thinks that he is something better.
2. Possessiveness: Too much jelausy or dependance. This can be shown if our partner wants too much attention or is too jelaus.
3. Rejection: We feel like our partner is rejecting us. He doesn't respond to our emotions and feelings and lets us to deal with them. Or we can have the feeling that if we would not write, he would definitely not write as well.

Even if we think that the conflicts in the relationship are not healthy, they are.
So don't be afraid to say that we need to talk about our relationship. It is even a good practice to
talk about it on some monthly basis. Create a list of things that you need to discuss with your spouse
and talk about it.

You have the right on your feelings and you have the right to share them. Find a safe way how to do that.
It is OK to feel not well, not loved, too criticised or to feel that you are not going where you should
and where you agreed that you will go. Open this topic. Do not be afraid. Learn how to have
unconditional positive respect.

Don't forget that each individual sees the life through his eyes, his emotions and his experience.
There is no truth in the relationship, just a different view on that situation. And the hard problems
doesn't have a simple solutions. 

### What to ask

1. What are the topics that you argue about? 
2. Do you think that arguing is good for a relationship?
3. Is there some space where it is better for you to argue? 
4. Are you afraid of arguments because you are afraid of the break-up? 


## The raltionship itself



## Constant therapy
