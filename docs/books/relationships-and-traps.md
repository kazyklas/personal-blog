# Relationships and Traps

The book is from Honza Vojtko, it is his second book and it was 
released after the podcast series Vztahy a pasti.

## Boredom

The relationship gets boring at the time. That is a myth that is not true.
You may say, that at the beginning of the relationship, you felt the butterflies,
you thought that all will be good and you will be fulfilled till the end of times.

That is because of chemistry. Just pure instincts that our subconscious does 
for us. A huge amount of dopamine and serotonin is released for a few months.
Then the hormones get into a line again.

All of the feelings you don't have to feel and you are most likely not feeling bored at all.
There are three types of a situation when you feel bored:
1. If you are forbidden from doing what you want.
2. If you are forced to do something that you don't want
3. Sometimes is just a feeling that you can find out, why you have it.

All of this is coming from a lack of purpose. When you are a guy,
this is a huge issue. You should have a purpose, from small to great, but some.
Start with some hobbies, you will feel better. This is also true for  
females. If you are bored in a relationship, find out why are you feeling like that.
The other person is not there to satisfy your lack of purpose but to help you 
find one and stick to it. Find your purpose together and work on it as a team.

### What to Ask

1. Can I do something with my partner?
2. Do I let him inspire me?
3. Can I do the new activity, and pursue the purpose alone?
4. Can I share my achievements with my partner?
5. Why do I need to do something new? 
   

## Need for sex

Sexuality is a huge question, but why? Is it a question that we ask or is  
society putting a value to it? You will read that if you want a healthy relationship 
you will have to have sex twice a week. This is a huge mistake. Every person has it
differently. 

The main goal is to have intimacy that suits both of you. It can be holding hands,
kissing, or planning and having a quality time with some touches. Not everyone needs to
penetrate or be penetrated to have a good relationship if he doesn't want to.

Someone will likely want sex more in a relationship. It is not an issue,
if you will not use it as a weapon, as you can manipulate it with the one thing that 
the other one desire. 

There will also be ups and down in the long run. In this time, be open, and look for help 
from your spouse, you are going through it together. If it will be for a longer period, that someone doesn't want to have sex. Look deeper, it can be from some 
physical state or a state of mind that needs to be cured.

Remember that if you do not feel satisfied, talk about it, it can be not pleasant and it can 
be hurtful. There might be even more talks about it, cus you will not solve it through one
hour of talk if it is a bigger issue.

## What to ask

1. Did your desire change somehow in time?
2. Is it still the same as in the beginning?
3. Is your desire higher or lower than your spouse's?
4. Can you talk about it with your partner? (Couples that can talk about sex tend to have better sex.)
5. How do social networks affect your perception of sex?

## Relationship as a therapeutic coach

This trap is about using your partner as a therapist. You don't have to do it on 
purpose, but it will figure itself out. You will tell them, that they understand 
you better and in the edge cases. Some couples send the other person in a relationship
to the therapist to solve their problems for them.

You may also tend to find the reason for the partner's feelings, where did they 
come from? You may automatically analyze the person and not listen to what he says
or you can not enjoy the moment and live the emotions as well.

In a relationship, there is a right on having secrets. It is on you 
if you want to tell your partner. Do forget on using your partner to 
throw all your emotions on. None can handle it in a long-term relationship to 
be your pillow for emotions. Don't be afraid to advise searching for a professional for this.

## What to ask

1. Is your partner the first one, that you contact when something wrong happens to you, and all the good things you tell to someone else?
2. Are you talking with your partner about the negative and the positive things?
3. Do you expect some resolution from your partner?
4. Are you mad if the partner is not properly listening to you? 

## Parents instead of partners

The first shock for the relationship is the baby. There might be another shock,
but none with such damage as a kid. The partners tend to focus on the little ones
and they completely forget about the other person in the relationship.
The relationship is work and after a kid, double that work.

If we will focus on being a parent, we will lose ourselves. We have to constantly work
on the intimate relationship that we have. Partners can't start tolerating each other.
They will create a distance between themselves and it might not be repairable.

Don't just share what pampers you need to buy. Don't just be a parent.
Share love, send some pictures, talk about the love between you, and remember to work on it.

Be also prepared that have some urge to project our dreams and love to the baby.
It can cause damage to the kid and also to you and your partner.

### What to ask

1. Are you not talking about something, cus you are tired?
2. When was the last time you spent together when the kid fell asleep?
3. Do you believe that marriage is about creating children?
   
   
## Always at work

Everybody needs money, so we are going to work. This work can be great and can 
motivate us, but it can distract us from our relationship. It also can hide some 
problems that we are facing and hide from them there.

One study showed that staying late at work doesn't have to be an issue in a relationship.
We have to communicate, that this is something that is fulfilling us and we 
have a purpose there. If we do it properly and we find the right balance, the relationship 
can get even stronger.

The trick is in communication. We have to remind each other that work is 
something important to us. Once mentioned doesn't mean that much. We also have to 
react accordingly if the spouse is saying, that the work is affecting the relationship.

The necessity is to plan your week. If you have a tight schedule, take that few minutes
before the work week to plan. Plan the time with your partner. You can even plan
the sex. Yes we want some spontaneity, but planning is not killer, it can create 
anticipation as well.

### What to ask

1. When was the last time we texted or called our partner how they are doing?
2. On a scale, how does it irritate you that your partner is working nonstop?
3. How much guilt are you feeling that you are working too much?
4. Do you enjoy the work, or do you work, because you need to?

## Social networks

They are a huge thing in our time. They can cause a lot of trouble, but it is not
their mistake, it is ours and how we are using them. A lot of people are on  
social networks for a lot of time. If you want to have a serious relationship
you have to focus on it with full attention.

We keep on this media a lot of connections. If you add a photo, someone from the 
past or even someone you don't even know reacts. You can keep this person somehow 
on the leash and you can have a backup if the relationship will not work out. 
It doesn't have to be now, or a week, but it can happen.

If I would bring up some numbers, that's that we touch our phones 2600 times a day!
We can spend those 2600 touches on our partner, that would be that 15 minutes each day
that will make a huge difference.

There are a lot of profiles that will change your perception of your relationship.
Why are they laughing all the time, they don't have any issues, and so on...
Everybody has issues, you don't have to put yourself into this illusion trap.
Statistically, partners, that are sharing a lot of pictures whit each other, are not
actually that happy in a relationship. But the ones, that have the other one on the 
profile pictures tend to have stronger relationships.

### What to ask

1. How much time are you spending on social media?
2. When was the last time that you ate with your partner without looking at the phone? 
3. Did you argue about social media? 
4. Do you like yourself more thanks to social media?

## The cursed romance

The love on the first sign is not a myth. But a huge computation is done by our subconscious.
What does this mean? If we like somebody, if we are romantically attracted to them, we most 
likely have different genes so our potential children have more chances of surviving.
So nature created this process and when you see someone with a set of different values.
You are in a trap, the brain starts to release the soup of hormones and you are done (for a while).

All of how we are looking at the relationship has to do with romanticism. This shaped our 
perceptions and what we are expecting from the relationship. The love till the end of time,
everything is fine after we find the right one, and so on. Before marriage was here to 
merge the properties of two families and to create children.

We have to have in mind that we are choosing the partner just on our emotions and feelings.
This can lead to not having that great relationship in the long term as we get to know the other one better.
In the first stages, we are in love with just our imagination of a person. We have to take time 
to get to know each other, don't fall into a trap of an early relationship with the vision 
of access to sex. 

The other thing that we need to avoid is, that there is no, once more, there is no template for
how the relationship should look, or how we should feel. Every relationship is different 
and the feelings that we have are different as well. We don't have to have the butterflies 
when we see each other at the first sight, we just don't have to smell bad to each other.

And the last few points. Love and sex are not the same. One can lead to another and one is 
not the prerequisite for the other. Someone can be, and that is OK as well. Talks about 
money and property are not a betrayal of love, but a necessity we need to go through. When 
we realize that we all are just people that are doing mistakes, we will create better 
relationships. So don't forget to learn how to communicate and how to respect each other.

### What to ask

1. Does your partner understands your feelings?
2. What is it that you expect from your partner? 
3. How often do you think, if this is how the relationship should be and how it should feel?
4. Do you avoid tough conversations, because you don't think that they should be included in a relationship?
5. Do you believe in destiny?

## Parents

Parents, without a doubt, have an enormous impact on our relationships in adult life.
This might be good, but not always. As I like to say, you can not fuck up the kid. It is up to us
to find what patterns are coded in our heads and is up to us to "upgrade" ourselves to 
better people. So the important thing to do is to determine, where my communication and 
emotional patterns came from. Identify them, communicate them, and get rid of those that you 
don't want. 

We will discuss two archetypes. The arguing one and the passive-aggressive one. Both
are not great. One needs to get more constructive with arguing to bring something positive
and the other one needs to learn how to express his emotions. Create a safe bridge in your 
relationship where you can communicate your emotions within a safe space.

Figure out what you are searching for in a partner. Is it something that will compensate for the 
areas, where you are not confident enough? I once also heard: "Create a list of what you 
are searching for in your partner and become that person."

You have to watch for a trap in your relationship, that you might have a big connection 
to someone in your family. This may cause a weak point in the connection with your partner.
Don't include your parents in an argument. Don't allow your parents to tell you what your 
relationship should look like. It can lead to serious problems. Do not be afraid to tell
that the connection is causing this and that and you are not comfortable with it.
The relationship is created by two people and no one should dictate how you should have it.

There was introduced a great concept of how we should treat our kids. When they are young,
keep them close, hug them, and protect them. And as they grow older, release the hug a bit. Let 
them get their burns and welcome them if they need help. And as they become adults, wait
with their hands spread. Appreciate the time when they come to you. Hug them and then 
let them build their life and family. It will hurt, but it is your job and you have to be strong.

### What to ask

1. How often do you take advice from your parents?
2. When was the last time you attacked your partner that they behave like their parents?
3. Do you talk about your intimate life with your parents?
4. Why and how often are you afraid of what they will tell about your partner?

## Always positive

In recent studies were found, that we argue mostly because of these three reasons:
1. Haughtiness: This means that our partner is making fools of us. Dehonests us or makes fun of us. He thinks that he is something better.
2. Possessiveness: Too much jealousy or dependence. This can be shown if our partner wants too much attention or is too jealous.
3. Rejection: We feel like our partner is rejecting us. He doesn't respond to our emotions and feelings and lets us deal with them. Or we can have the feeling that if we would not write, he would not write as well.

Even if we think that the conflicts in the relationship are not healthy, they are.
So don't be afraid to say that we need to talk about our relationship. It is even a good practice to
talk about it on a monthly basis. Create a list of things that you need to discuss with your spouse
and talk about it.

You have the right to your feelings and you have the right to share them. Find a safe way how to do that.
It is OK to feel not well, not loved, too criticized or to feel that you are not going where you should
and where you agreed that you will go. Open this topic. Do not be afraid. Learn how to have
unconditional positive respect.

Don't forget that each individual sees life through his eyes, his emotions, and his experience.
There is no truth in the relationship, just a different view of that situation. And the hard problems
don't have simple solutions. 

### What to ask

1. What are the topics that you argue about? 
2. Do you think that arguing is good for a relationship?
3. Is there some space where it is better for you to argue? 
4. Are you afraid of arguments because you are afraid of the breakup? 


## The relationship itself

The "toxic" relationship. I would rather say, not healthy relationships are created when 
at least one of the relationship needs is not fulfilled. One of the partners feels 
the threat or even danger from the other one. Most likely, the relationship is 
suffering from bad communication or continuous conflicts that are not resolved or healed properly.
We can also find a lack of true love and emotional intimacy.

The eight things that we are searching for in a relationship:
1. Safety: We have to know that the relationship is a safe space to be in and to grow in. That we can feel protected and respected. 
2. Appreciation: We need to be appreciated for what we are, with all our insecurities. We have to believe and expect, that everything the other does has a purpose and meaning for him and we need to try to understand the meaning.
3. Acceptance: We have to be such a partner, that the other one can use as a shield and can care about us. We also need to feel cared about and respected.
4. Reciprocity: We can understand the things that the other ones are living. That means that if the other one is having a problem with some situation in life, we already know that situation and we can relate to each other. A great example is a common trauma.
5. Self-definition: We have to define ourselves in the relationship. We have to have space to be ourselves, do what we love and we have to be different. This difference has to be accepted and loved.
6. Couse reaction: We have to have the ability to change the other's perspective and thoughts. Not in a manipulative way. We have to see and know that we can change our perspective and that we can cause some emotions. We also have to have the ability to spot the difference after our actions.
7. Show of love: There are 5 languages of love. Everyone is receiving and gives love differently. Hugs, gifts, words. We have to catch such an attempt to reach for our heart and we have to learn to give it differently.
8. Initiative: Both people in a relationship have to show initiative for something. If someone is feeling that just him is doing all the things, he will burn out. Try to initiate anything from time to time.

We have to take care of our relationship and if we can find that four riders of the apocalypse are present.
1. Critics,
2. contempt,
3. defense,
4. disconnection.

When those are present, we are likely to be separated. It is OK if we find them in an argument from
time to time. Nobody is able to hold himself when we pull the right strings which the other one 
definitely knows. If we realize that they are present, stop, take a minute, search for which need is not 
fulfilled, and work on that.

### What to ask

1. Do you feel lonely in your current relationship?
2. Did you feel this in previous relationships?
3. Do you fear that your partner will leave you?
4. What is the tabu in your relationship?


## Constant therapy

This is about the therapy itself. We tend to tell the spouse to go visit a therapist.
It seems that in the first few sessions, it is better but after a few years, we are still there.
We have to find maybe someone else or stop because it is not bringing anything positive.

We also have to look into our relationship. Are visiting therapy, to just tell 
someone that we pay about our feelings so we don't have to tell them at home? 
It can be effective, but not in the long term.
