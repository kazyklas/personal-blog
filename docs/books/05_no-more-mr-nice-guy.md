### Their characteristics

1. Nice guys are givers. They look at the giving as a pass for the other people to love them.
2. Nice guys fix and caretake. If there is a problem, they will try to fix it. 
3. Nice guys seek approval from others. They seek the validation. They are calculating the the outcome to gain approval and avoid disapproval.
4. Nice guys avoid conflict. They tend to be without any issues, because they think that everyone loves people without any issues.
5. Nice Guys believe they must hide their perceived flaws and mistakes. These men are afraid that others will get mad at them, shame them, or leave them if some mistake or shortcoming is exposed.
6. Nice guys seek the "right" way to do things. There is a believe that there is a way, that will be always good and nothing will go wrong.
7. Nice Guys repress their feelings. The first comes the analyzation, rather then felling. 
8. Nice Guys often try to be different from their fathers. Many Nice Guys report having unavailable, absent, passive, angry, philandering, or alcoholic fathers. It is not unusual for these men to make a decision at some point in their lives to try to be 180 degrees different from Dad.
9. Nice Guys are often more comfortable relating to women than to men. They tend to have less male friends. The right approval are received by woman, so they keep the women closer.
10. Nice Guys have difficulty making their needs a priority. They think that it is selfish to put their needs first. 
11. Nice Guys often make their partner their emotional center. They are only happy when their partner is happy. Therefore they put a lot of energy into their relationship.

### What is wrong about them

1. Nice guys are dishonest. These men hide their mistakes, avoid conflict, say what they think people want to hear, and repress their feelings.
2. Nice Guys are secretive. They are hiding everything that might upset the others. "If at fist you don't succeed, hide the evidence."
3. Nice Guys are compartmentalized. Therefore, a married man can create his own definition of fidelity which allows him to deny that he had an affair with his secretary (or intern) because he never put his penis in her vagina.
4. Nice Guys are manipulative. Nice Guys tend to have a hard time making their needs a priority and have difficulty asking for what they want in clear and direct ways. This creates a sense of powerlessness. Therefore, they frequently resort to manipulation when trying to get their needs met.
5. Nice Guys are controlling. A major priority for Nice Guys is keeping their world smooth. This creates a constant need to try to control the people and things around them.
6. Nice Guys give to get. Though Nice Guys tend to be generous givers, their giving often has unconscious and unspoken strings attached. Nice Guys often report feeling frustrated or resentful as a result of giving so much while seemingly getting so little in return.
7. Nice Guys are passive-aggressive.  Nice Guys tend to express their frustration and resentment in indirect, roundabout, and not so nice ways. This includes being unavailable, forgetting, being late, not following through, not being able to get an erection, climaxing too quickly, and repeating the same annoying behaviors even when they have promised to never do them again.
8. Nice Guys are full of rage. Though Nice Guys frequently deny ever getting angry, a lifetime of frustration and resentment creates a pressure cooker of repressed rage deep inside these men. This rage tends to erupt at some of the most unexpected and seemingly inappropriate times.
9. Nice Guys are addictive. Addictive behavior serves the purpose of relieving stress, altering moods, or medicating pain. Since Nice Guys tend to keep so much bottled up inside, it has to come out somewhere.
10. Nice Guys have difficulty setting boundaries. Many Nice Guys have a hard time saying "no," "stop," or "I'm going to." They often feel like helpless victims and see the other person as the cause of the problems they are experiencing.
11. Nice Guys are frequently isolated. Though Nice Guys desire to be liked and loved, their behaviors actually make it difficult for people to get very close to them.
12. Nice Guys are often attracted to people and situations that need fixing. This behavior is often the result of the Nice Guy's childhood conditioning, his need to look good, or his quest for approval. 
13. Nice Guys frequently have problems in intimate relationships.
14. Nice Guys have issues with sexuality.
15. Nice Guys are usually only relatively successful. The majority of Nice Guys I've met have been talented, intelligent, and moderately successful. Almost without exception though, they fail to live up to their full potential.
