# The Way of the Superior Man

This book is truly exceptional and should be read by all boys and men. While we live in a society that promotes gender equality, it's important to recognize our inherent differences. Neither gender is superior or inferior to the other; we simply cannot exist without one another. Let's delve into this book and explore its contents using my words.

## A Man's Way
1. **Stop Hoping for Completion of Anything in Life.** Life is a grind. Don't deceive yourself into thinking otherwise. To be a man, you must find a way to grow and sustain that energy. There will never be a day when you can say that everything is done. Be in the moment, and don't wish for it to pass. Play, love, and enjoy the gift of the present.

2. **Live with an Open Heart Even if it Hurts.** Keep your heart open, even if you have been hurt in the past or will be hurt in the future. Know that you will get through it and live up to your full potential.

3. **Live as If Your Father Were Dead.** Be the strongest man at his funeral. Don't try to fulfill his expectations. Define your own expectations and move past his criticisms.

4. **Know Your Real Edge and Don't Fake It.** Everyone has limits. Know your own and don't try to be someone else. If you're afraid of heights, admit it, live with it, try to push past it, or move slightly beyond the edge. Never fake something you're not. The more you hold to your limits and edges, the more trustworthy you'll be.

5. **Always Hold to Your Deepest Realizations.** Define your values and protect them. They are fundamental to you. They can change over time, but once you commit to them, follow them completely.

6. **Never Change Your Mind Just to Please a Woman.** Stand behind your opinion and don't change it just to please anyone, not even a man or your superior. But don't argue with stupid people. If someone's argument is better than yours and you realize that you were wrong, don't hesitate to change your mind.

7. **Your Purpose Must Come Before Your Relationship.** I don't fully agree with this statement. Would you want to be with someone who prioritizes work over you all the time? What I take from this is that you should have a purpose and prioritize it over pleasing someone you're in a relationship with.

8. **Lean Just Beyond Your Edge.** Know your limits and edges, and always push yourself slightly beyond them. But don't go too far. Of course, from time to time, you'll stray from your edges but don't make it a habit or do it for someone else.

9. **Do It for Love.** Men should always live with an open heart and be prepared to get hurt. But they should also enjoy love and do things for it. In the world, there are three fundamental things: inevitable pain and two things that can lead you and save you from pain: truth and love. Live for them, be prepared for pain, and overcome it with the other two.

10. **Enjoy Your Friends' Criticisms.** Surround yourself with people you can count on, and appreciate their opinions. They'll tell you if you're in the wrong place because they want the best for you. Also, remember that they see you through their own eyes, not yours. There are multiple truths, and

11. **If you don't know your purpose, discover it, now.**
    
12. **Be willing to change everything in your life.** Don't be afraid to let something go. Have enough confidence that you will survive it because you are living with an open heart and your purpose will be more important than losing something for discovering something better.

13. **Don't use your family as an excuse.** 
    
14. **Don't get lost in tasks and duties.** Always enjoy life and be there for others, do not get lost in work, or other tasks that are not going in the same direction as your purpose.

15. **Stop hoping for your woman to get easier.** She will never be better, accept her with all her flaws and love her, because that is exactly what she needs. You support her and show her love and direction when she is exploding with her emotions. And do not complain about her, if you do, you are just carrying the sign with the words "I'm an idiot, who has a poor choice". 

## Dealing with a woman

1. **Women are not liars.** You would say that when you are listening to a woman, she will always switch the answer. That is because she answers the question with what she feels right now. That means that one day you can hear that she loves you, the other day she will tell you that she hates you. They are driven by emotions more and they respond to them more than to the rational thoughts. 

2. **Praise her.** Man grows by challenge, and women grow by appreciation. Praise her for all the things you want from her and the ones that you love about her. Do not respond negatively to the action you want to happen again. Learn to notice small changes and complement those. Maybe the hair is somehow different, or the nails, complement that.

3. **Tolerating her leads to resenting her.** In a relationship, you should never tolerate it. You should always respect, you are on the same level, if you start to tolerate, you will take apprehend and that will build up the resentment of both. Accept her, you chose her, you deal with her. But to some point, sometimes women have too much women's energy that you can't handle, then you should try to find someone else.

4. **Don't analyze your woman.** Do not try to analyze and solve the problem. She doesn't need that, she needs to talk herself out of it. Listen, acknowledge, and offer help or solutions. She will tell you if she wants it or not. Then listen and ask good questions. If you try to analyze her, you will become in a circle that you can't ever understand, you don't have such an emotional depth.

5. **Don't suggest that a woman fix her own emotional problems.** The emotions that the women have is a storm and she will never figure out why she feels the way she may feel. Have in mind the cycle, and the hunger, and then try to figure out the problem. Teach her to lower the edges and how to express her emotions to you with love and an open heart. 

6. **Stay with her intensity - to a point.** As mentioned above, girls are a storm, a beautiful storm, but sometimes, the storm tears down a lot of things, and when you repair them and another storm will break them. You will get tired of it and you will reach the point when you can't handle the storm anymore and you should move to the less stormy country.

7. **Don't force the feminine to make a decision.** This translates to leading the feminine energy. If the girl can't decide, as they have a real issue with this, just decide for them, lead the way, and take action with confidence. If the way will be wrong or you end up badly. You can handle it thanks to your leadership abilities. 

## Working with polarity and energy

1. **Your attraction to the feminine is inevitable.** You as a masculine man, will be always attracted to feminine energy, because you need it to be a better and masculine man. You will always attract women with the opposite energy. The more masculine, the more feminine energy you will attract. The more feminine energy you will have within yourself, the more masculine women you will attract.

2. **Choose a woman who is your complementary opposite.** Understand your energy and learn how to be floating in the energy of your spouse. If you will find a woman with a different energy from yours, it will not work out. You will see her as more chaotic and laying if you have more feminine energy. But if you are really masculine, she will inspire you and heal you better with this kind of energy.

3. **Know what is important in your woman.** Find out what you want from your woman, and what feminine traits you want to find in her. Answer this to yourself. If it is her power for caring or her ability to dress and look pretty.

4. **You will often want more than one woman.** There will always be more girls in the room. You have to learn to be faithful and to accept the energy of other women. You don't need to have anything sexual with them. They can charge you in different ways. Accept the energy and transfer it into actions.

5. **Young women offer you a special energy.** As well as the older women. The young are more energetic and pretty, but the older ones are smart and peaceful. They most likely learned their feminine energy and can work it much better. 

6. **Each woman has a temperature that can heal or irritate you.** That is the ultimate power of a woman. She can inspire you and heal you. But she also can irritate you and destroy your masculine energy so you will become a version that is silent and just tries to survive in a relationship.

## What woman really want

1. **Choose a woman who chooses you.** If you choose a woman, who doesn't choose you, she will never fully trust you. You should determine if she really wants you, or if she is playing hard to get. But if she doesn't want you, immediately stop trying, it will only lead to disappointment for both of you. 

2. **What she wants is not what she says.** If you will listen to a woman complaining and saying what she wants. It may not be the thing she really wants. If she tells you something that you should do, she may be just testing if you are weak enough to do it to please her. Be careful, women often test your boundaries and they will shit-test you. 

3. **Her complaint is content-free.** If she is complaining about something, it might just be some bells ringing, that you should somehow return to your purpose, to return to your frame. She always wants a masculine man beside her. The complaint often doesn't tell you exactly what you should do or the steps. 

4. **She doesn't really want to be number one.** You should always have your higher purpose in mind. And you should not do the things to make her happy and number one. She wants you to have a purpose and she will test, how much you want to pursue it.

5. **Your excellent track record is meaningless to her.** It doesn't make any sense to her. The feminine energy doesn't take records or take the history of how you behaved for the last 10 years, but they will consider the exact moment, and how you made them feel. 

6. **She wants to relax in the demonstration of your directions.** The woman has too much stress than they can handle. You have to lead them with the direction and provide the hideout behind you. Also, the best relaxation that the woman can have is in your masculine hand providing her with love.

## Your dark side

1. **You are always searching for freedom.** You will be always searching for a time free of constraints. Search your hobbies to let the steam out and to be without any strings to feel free again.

2. **Own your darkest desires.**   

3. **She wants the killer in you.** Be fearless in the house. Remember that the only time that man can be brave is the time when he is afraid. Go kill that spider, it is your masculine purpose.

4. **She needs your consciousness to match her energy.** You need to match her energy and destructiveness. If you will show some weakness in it, she will test it. Only after you show her confidence in that weak spot, she will again start to fully trust you.

## Feminine attractiveness

1. **The feminine is abundant.** There is never a shortage of feminine energy, but there are a lot of people resenting it or not accepting it. 

2. **Allow older women their magic.**

3. **Turn your lust into gifts.**

4. **Never allow your desire to become suppressed or depolarized.** If you desire something, you should go for it with all the heart you have. You should not let anyone suppress you or transfer your desire to something else. 

5. **Use her attractiveness as a slingshot through appearance.**
