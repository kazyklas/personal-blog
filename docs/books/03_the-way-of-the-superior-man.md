# The Way of the Superior Man

This book is really something special that all boys and men should read. I know that we live in a society where men and women are considered equal, but in my experience and mindset, we are inherently different. We are not better or worse than each other, and we cannot exist without the other. Let's dive into this book and explore its contents with my words.

## A Man's Way
1. **Stop Hoping for Completion of Anything in Life.** Life is a grind. Don't deceive yourself into thinking otherwise. To be a man, you must find a way to grow and sustain that energy. There will never be a day when you can say that everything is done. Be in the moment, and don't wish for it to pass. Play, love, and enjoy the gift of the present.

2. **Live with an Open Heart Even if it Hurts.** Keep your heart open, even if you have been hurt in the past or will be hurt in the future. Know that you will get through it and live up to your full potential.

3. **Live as If Your Father Were Dead.** Be the strongest man at his funeral. Don't try to fulfill his expectations. Define your own expectations and move past his criticisms.

4. **Know Your Real Edge and Don't Fake It.** Everyone has limits. Know your own and don't try to be someone else. If you're afraid of heights, admit it, live with it, try to push past it or move slightly beyond the edge. Never fake something you're not. The more you hold to your limits and edges, the more trustworthy you'll be.

5. **Always Hold to Your Deepest Realizations.** Define your values and protect them. They are fundamental to you. They can change over time, but once you commit to them, follow them completely.

6. **Never Change Your Mind Just to Please a Woman.** Stand behind your opinion and don't change it just to please anyone, not even a man or your superior. But don't argue with stupid people. If someone's argument is better than yours and you realize that you were wrong, don't hesitate to change your mind.

7. **Your Purpose Must Come Before Your Relationship.** I don't fully agree with this statement. Would you want to be with someone who prioritizes work over you all the time? What I take from this is that you should have a purpose and prioritize it over pleasing someone you're in a relationship with.

8. **Lean Just Beyond Your Edge.** Know your limits and edges, and always push yourself slightly beyond them. But don't go too far. Of course, from time to time, you'll stray from your edges, but don't make it a habit or do it for someone else.

9. **Do It for Love.** Men should always live with an open heart and be prepared to get hurt. But they should also enjoy love and do things for it. In the world, there are three fundamental things: pain, which is inevitable, and two things that can lead you and save you from pain: truth and love. Live for them, be prepared for pain, and overcome it with the other two.

10. **Enjoy Your Friends' Criticisms.** Surround yourself with people you can count on, and appreciate their opinions. They'll tell you if you're in the wrong place because they want the best for you. Also, remember that they see you through their own eyes, not yours. There are multiple truths, and

11. **If you don't know your purpose, discover it, now.**
    
12. **Be willing to change everything in your life.** Don't be afraid to let something go. Have enough confidence that you will survive it, because you are living with the open heart and your purpose that will be more important than losing something for discovering something better.

13. **Don't use your family as an excuse.** 
    
14. **Don't get lost in task and duties.** Always enjoy life and be there for others, do not get lost in work, or other tasks that are not going in the same direction as your purpose.

15. **Stop hoping for your woman to get easier.** She will never be better, accept her with all her flaws and love her, because that is exactly what she needs. You to support her and show her love and direction when she is exploding with her emotions. And do not complain about her, if you do, you are just carrying the sign with the words "I'm an idiot, who has a poor choice".
