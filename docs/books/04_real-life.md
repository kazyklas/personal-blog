# The real life

Book is written by multiple authors. The authors are therapeutist and coaches.
Each of them has two chapters in which they talk about a certain problem.
I will go through the chapters (problems) and I will try to explain it with my own words.

## Stop tolerating the energy eaters

Imagine your energy as a battery that your phone has.
In the morning, you wake up and you go out doing something. It will drain your battery and then you 
come home to the family that will drain even more of your energy and at the end of the day, you will 
be exhausted without any motivation for doing the same tomorrow. 

This may indicate that throughout the day, you didn't do anything that would recharge your battery a bit.
Or maybe you were doing a little bit more activities that drains your battery too much. 
What you should do now? You should identify the things that drains your spirit. 
It can be anything, from the friends, family, work and so on. 

Do yourself a favor and define the things that drain you and also define a things that will recharge you.
Maybe after you get home, you need a few minutes to just sit down and listen to some music before you 
hit the wall of the real life that is awaiting you at home. And maybe that is all that it needs to 
be done in order for you to operate as a good parent and spouse. Just a little bit of recharge.

After you identify battery eaters and fillers, you should let your friends or close friends know that you
found out this about yourself and that you would like them to respect the new you.
You may find that in order to function as a normal adult, you have to have some time for yourself.
Go out to the woods, play, read or do something that will recharge your battery. 
Communicate your needs and borders.

And after the communication and defining what the eaters are, cut them off.


## Make strong parts from the weakest

Everyone is trying to hide something. Some wounds, some good things or some bad things as well.
We are raised as someone that should be in the middle. Be a part of the group, don't stick out.
Hide your needs and your opinions that would be out of a "normal" zone. This is just making us 
average. And we don't want to be average, we want to stand out and left the mark on the peoples hearts,
or somewhere else, you choose. 

Now, you were hiding something all your life in you. It doesn't have to be that bad that it needs hiding.
Maybe its your voice, that you don't like. So you hide it, you are not talking that loud and you may hide it
and you may not say something just because you didn't want to expose it.

Now try to embrace the weak spot in you. Take the responsibility of owning that part of you.
In the end it is a part of you that you should accept and love it as well as the good parts.
You can forgive yourself that you may have this weak spot and you may hold it open for others.
You will gain soo much confidence out of that, people around you will start to feel more safe as you
will expose the weak spots, you will acknowledge that you are not perfect, no one is and never will be.

So go out, take the bad spot in yourself and light it up. Don't be average as everyone else.
Stick out with all the things that makes you you. Then you will lose your constraints and you can 
be on the begging of the route to the real and better life.


## Be selfish

This chapter is about taking care of yourself and putting you on the top of your priority list.
You may already take this as an attack on you. On how you should be a priority on the list, when
you have children and family that you need to take care of? Well I really don't care if you feel attacked.
You should do it anyways. Because if you don't follow the first chapter and you put everyone else 
above you, it will destroy you in the long run. You can't be good parent if you are used by 
your children and you can't be a great father if you don't know your value and do everything for others.

I'm suggesting starting small as learning to say no to things that doesn't 
correspond with you. Maybe you would like to be at home alone, but friends are calling you out.
Then you would go just to satisfy their needs of having you out there with them but you would not 
respect yourself and your needs. 

The main thing from this is to respect yourself as well as you respect others. And if you don't like anything 
in your life, be so self centered that you will eliminate it even though someone would not like it.
Let's take something that you don't like in your life. Take it and change it, maybe you are doing something 
just to please someone else. Tell them that you don't want to do it, that it is not something that you want to do, 
be strict and resentful. Again, create a border and respect it. Find the people that respect it as well and 
stick to them. Friends or people that doesn't respect you and your borders doesn't deserve you in the first place.

## Acknowledge and find your needs

Maybe this chapter should be as the first one as a lot of things depend on this. 
Find the difference between I need and I want. You can see the difference in the end.
If you don't have what you wanted or that you thought that you needed and nothing changed.
It was most likely just the I want thing.

Huge point that should be stressed out from this part is to stop wanting others to fulfill your needs.
You should be self sufficient person that fulfill his needs by himself. If you will put the burden 
on satisfying your needs on someone else, you will be constantly complaining that that person is 
not giving you enough of it and you will need more and more and it will never be enough.
If you are doing this, identify it and try to fulfill from yourself. The best examples are the relationships 
that we are having. Why do you need some relationship at all? What it does for you and for your needs? 

If you are feeling a strong emotions, use them as a navigation. They always come hand to hand with your needs.
And for better navigation in the needs, here is a list of the from the book and the definitions:

### Needs

1. Self-transcendence - is a personality trait that involves the expansion of personal boundaries, including, potentially, 
    experiencing spiritual ideas such as considering oneself an integral part of the universe.
2. Self-actualization -  is the highest level of psychological development, where personal potential 
    is fully realized after basic bodily and ego needs have been fulfilled.
3. Aesthetic needs - appreciation and search for beauty, balance, form. Always in search never in reach.
4. Cognitive needs - knowledge and understanding, curiosity, exploration, need for meaning and predictability.
5. Self-worth - knowing or feeling that you are a good person who deserves to be treated with respect
6. Love and beeing a part of something
