# Stoicism 

Stoicism is a philosophy that originated in ancient Greece and emphasizes the importance of **reason, self-control, and acceptance of one's circumstances**. The Stoics believed that the key to happiness and inner peace was to focus on what was within one's control, and to accept and endure what was beyond one's control with equanimity.

## The following are some of the core values and beliefs of Stoicism:

1. **Virtue is the only true good**: The Stoics believed that the only thing that truly mattered in life was the cultivation of moral character, and that all other things were ultimately unimportant.

2. **The dichotomy of control**: The Stoics divided things in life into two categories: things that are within our control (**our thoughts, actions, and values**) and things that are outside of our control (**our environment, other people's actions, and natural events**). 

3. **Live in accordance with nature**: The Stoics believed that we should live in harmony with the natural world and the universe, and that we should strive to live in accordance with our own nature as rational beings.

4. **Embrace adversity**: The Stoics believed that adversity was an opportunity for growth and self-improvement, and that we should welcome challenges as opportunities to develop our character.

5. **The importance of mindfulness**: The Stoics believed that we should practice mindfulness and self-reflection in order to gain greater awareness of our thoughts, emotions, and actions.
