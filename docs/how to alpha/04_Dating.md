# Dating

I was recently listening to some podcast about dating tips. It was from the perspective of a woman.
So here I go, puting out my knowledge on how the male should put himself on the dating market.

## Tinder

Where should you be dating nowadays based on study and questioners? 
The top place to find dates according to 45% respondents was online dating apps, 
followed by being connected by a friend (33%) and concerts or festivals (32%).

If the festivals are not for you, you have to go online. So you are an avarage male,
here are some number: 
It was determined that the bottom 80% of men (in terms of attractiveness) are competing 
for the bottom 22% of women and the top 78% of women are competing for the top 20% of men.

This leads to setting up the profile, so you catch as much matches as possible.

### Photos

Set up the photos so you have there these 3 things for sure:

1. Your entire body so they know what to expect.
2. Photo, where you are doing something, your hobby or something that you like.
3. Photo with a genuine smile.

What you should avoid in photos:

1. Don't have beer there.
2. No photos with car (if it is expensive, then maybe consider it).
3. No photos where you are catching fish.
4. No photos with ex girlfriends.
5. Shirtless photos. 

### Bio

Don't try too hard, have there some basic information, maybe just a phrase that invites somewhere.
Examples:
1. Let's grab a drink.
2. Would be happy to show you my favorite coffee shop.
3. Let's philosophy about the meaning.

This will lead to immediate conversation that can potentially lead to asking the person out.

### Summary of tips

You have to be quick, when you are competing with other men, you have to be fast to reply and in a few messages setup a date.
If you will take long to reply and it will be boring, they will have someone else.
And as should you, don't focus on just one girl, you have to have options here. It will help you 
with getting rid of the needy vibes that you might have.

For the first message, catch something special on her profile, some hobbies, dresses or smile.
This will indicate that you are interested and that you check her profile with genuine interest.

Setting up the date should be clear and without much options. You have to take a lead.
So something like: "Hey, I would really love to meet you, what about a walk on Thursday at 6 p.m.?".
This way, you are taking the lead and you look confident and you look like you know what you are doing.

## Date itself

Be authentic, don't play some roles that you can't hold for a long period of time. (I'm assuming that you search for something that will last.)
Talk about something that you have in common or try to find something like this so you can 
have longer conversation about. A good tip is to also take some snacks if you are going for a walk for example.
This way, she might remember you and it will also create a sense of debt that she might return on a second date.
