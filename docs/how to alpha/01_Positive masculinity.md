# Positive Masculinity

It's a male centric backlash movement towards a female centric modern world. 
It sustains that if you are a man, you should become strong both physically and mentally and reject modern 
concepts such as: <strong>toxic masculinity, simping, white knighting, fatphobia </strong>
(don't go to the gym, date fat girls), etc.

Modernity in this case is portrayed as a dominant world view where diversity and inclusivity 
at all levels are preferred at the expense of a traditional male mentality. 

Masculinity in this case is defined as the heritage and nature of men to solve problems, 
be strong and lead the world. It suggests that men should be <strong>stoic, heroic, and strong </strong>
for the world to be a better place and avoid the decay and descent towards depravity modernity offers.

### Positive masculinity traits

1. Emotional Intelligence: Men who are emotionally intelligent can understand and manage their own emotions, as well as the emotions of those around them. They are able to communicate effectively and empathize with others.
1. Responsibility: A responsible man takes accountability for his actions and decisions. He understands the consequences of his actions and strives to do what is right.
1. Courage: Courageous men have the strength to face their fears and take risks. They stand up for what they believe in and do what is right, even in the face of adversity.
1. Integrity: Men with integrity have a strong moral compass and stick to their principles, even when it's not easy. They are honest, trustworthy, and dependable.
1. Compassion: Men who show compassion are kind and caring towards others. They are able to put themselves in other people's shoes and treat others with respect and empathy.

### Toxic masculinity traits:

1. Aggressiveness: Men who display toxic masculinity can be aggressive and violent. They may use physical force to assert dominance and control over others.
   - Don't be aggressive when it is not needed. But be capable of being aggressive and dangerous, here is the difference. Have the ability to be dangerous, but do not chose to be.
2. Emotional repression: Toxic masculinity often teaches men to suppress their emotions, which can lead to an inability to express themselves and connect with others on an emotional level. 
    - Use your emotions, control them and address them. You can't choose, how you feel but you can choose how you react. 
3. Misogyny: Misogynistic men view women as inferior and may treat them with disrespect and disregard their opinions or abilities.
   - Men and Women are different types of human species. There will always be a difference. But those differences should be embraced, not disrespected. Learn how to handle the masculine energy and women energy to understand both worlds.
4. Homophobia: Men who display toxic masculinity may be intolerant of those who do not conform to traditional gender roles or sexual orientation, which can lead to discrimination and prejudice towards LGBTQ+ individuals.
    - Let all of the people do what they want and have the opinion that they have. Stand strong behind your values and believes, don't force them on someone else, but carry them proudly.
5. Dominance: Men who display toxic masculinity may have a strong desire to assert their dominance over others, including women and other men. This can lead to a lack of respect for boundaries and a sense of entitlement to power and control.
   - Don't force your power on others to let them know that you are in control. If you are true and want the best for the group, you will find the opportunities to take control, because nobody will do that. Walk with your chest open and head straight, don't break the eye contact and you will be dominant without any other forces.
