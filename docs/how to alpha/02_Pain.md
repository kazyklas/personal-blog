# Pain

Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. It is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling, actual or potential tissue damage.

Pain is mostly physical. It signals to our body that something is not okay, and the brain sends a signal to protect us from further harm. For example, if you kick your toe on a table, the brain registers the pain, and you instinctively pull your leg up to protect it. You may even attack the table due to primal instincts and defenses activating.

Pain is designed to make us aware of ourselves in the world. When we are young and growing, we may kick or hit something with our body, which tells the brain where our body ends and where objects begin. This helps us learn to avoid similar injuries in the future.

There is also mental pain, which can hurt just as much as physical pain. Emotional damage from things like a breakup or a death can cause the same areas of the brain to activate, and the brain reacts accordingly to protect us.

Although pain is often viewed negatively, it serves a purpose in our lives. It helps us become aware of ourselves and avoid similar injuries in the future. Moreover, pain can make us stronger. When a bone breaks, it will heal and become stronger. Similarly, muscles that tear apart during exercise will recover and grow stronger during sleep. If we learn to view pain as something positive, we can reduce anxiety levels and increase dopamine levels, which motivates us to keep going through difficult times.

Therefore, I encourage you to embrace pain, prepare for it, and handle it. By doing so, you can become one step closer to becoming 1% better every day. You will gain confidence and demonstrate dominance in a society that often focuses more on emotions than strength and discipline.
